/*
 * MiniIOMobileFramebuffer: a stand-in for Apple's display driver family, as seen by
 * IOMobileFramebuffer.framework (and through it by CoreAnimation's window server).
 *
 * The display is the framebuffer the boot loader left us (the one the kernel's text console
 * draws on). There is no hardware behind it that we drive: a "swap" copies the pixels of the
 * surfaces of its layers into that memory, and "vsync" is a timer.
 *
 * The protocol (selectors and the layout of the swap request) was worked out from the
 * user-space side of iOS 16.5. Everything not implemented is logged once.
